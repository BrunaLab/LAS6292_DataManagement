In some weeks, however, assignment will be the submission of questions for group discussion or brief reflection on the issues from the readings. Most in-class assignments are designed to be completed during the class session, but to ensure students master the concepts rather than rush through them they can be submitted anytime until 9 am the following Monday.\nData Cleaning Project This project is an opportunity to put some of the lessons learned into practice with a data set of your own. Your assignment is to (1) clean and organize a \u0026lsquo;messy\u0026rsquo; data set and prepare metadata describing the resulting \u0026lsquo;clean\u0026rsquo; data. The complete project requires the submission of these three items via the course Canvas website:\n(1) R code that imports, cleans, and organizes, and saves \u0026lsquo;messy\u0026rsquo; data (please make sure I have access to the original \u0026lsquo;messy\u0026rsquo; data by either providing a link or the data themselves. If these data cannot be shared because of privacy / confidentiality concerns please let me know in advance so we can arrange an alternative means for me to review them);\n(2) The resulting \u0026lsquo;clean\u0026rsquo; (i.e., corrected and organized) data in an appropriate format (e.g., .csv, .txt).\n(3) Metadata describing the corrected data set (This can either be in the form of the link to a github repository or the submissio of a file in .txt or .pdf format).\nDue Date \u0026amp; Point Value: The assignment is due 30 April 2021 by 5 pm and is worth 650 points\nComplete details regarding the project - including deadlines and grading rubrics - can be found here.\nDMP for Thesis Research The Data Management Plan (DMP) is a critical document describing the data to be collected for a research project, how it will be stored and managed, and the investigator with primary responsibility for its management. Many funding agencies, including NSF and NIH, now require a DMP with all grant applications. Each student will prepare a Data Management Plan (DMP) for their thesis research. The assignment, deadline, and evaluation rubric are available here.\n","date":1536451200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"section","lang":"en","lastmod":1536451200,"objectID":"0e0608d80e3ac85995e39ea1c072f2ce","permalink":"https://BrunaLab.github.io/docs/assignments/","publishdate":"2018-09-09T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/docs/assignments/","section":"docs","summary":"An overview of the assignments to be completed by each student","tags":null,"title":"","type":"book"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"File Formats, Naming conventions, Storage, and Security UF Data Storage Solutions GatorCloud Rread why I suggest NOT using MS One Drive here UF Dropbox for Education Information FAQ \u0026amp;

I\u0026rsquo;m guessing that you are also feeling tired, frustrated, and a bit zoomed-out. Plus just when we were figuring out how to do all of our classes in a fully asynchronous style, UF threw \u0026ldquo;HyFlex\u0026rdquo; at us\u0026hellip;and just when we were figuring that out, we moved to in-person. And now\u0026hellip;well, here we are. I hope you will continue to be patient with me - and with each other - as we learn to navigate this new-new-new(again) environment in which we are learning together.\nIn the meantime, I wanted to let you all know a few things:\n  Class will be meeting on Friday. There are no assignments or reading that need to be done in advance of the first session.\n  The class will meet in 376 Grinter Hall. Your health and safety are my first priority; I encourage you to wear a mask in class.\n  The zoom link for office hours can be found on the class Canvas page. If you have any problems logging on you can send me a message.\n  The fact that we\u0026rsquo;ve been dealing with this since March 2020 doesn\u0026rsquo;t mean it\u0026rsquo;s gotten easier or less stressful. In fact, I feel like it\u0026rsquo;s the opposite - in my house we continue to operate on what we call \u0026ldquo;Survival Mode\u0026rdquo;. If you have to miss class, or need extra time to complete work, or just need some time away - no problem, no explanation needed. Just let me know and if I can help in any way. Along those lines\u0026hellip;\n  I\u0026rsquo;m working to make the class as \u0026ldquo;flipped\u0026rdquo; as possible, and also developing an online version of thew course. After the first session, most of the remaining weeks will have the following format:\na) Before class: videos and reading introducing the topic for the week\nb) During Class: hands-on work and in-class exercises to apply the lessons learned (with submission of some materials for me to review)\nc) After class: finish any exercises not completed during class time, prepare for next session.\nd) Once in a while there might be some short lectures to better cover challenging material, and there are a few days where we will have a class discussion of the reading.\n  I\u0026rsquo;ve tried to keep the time commitments, reading, and assignments to a minimum. The \u0026ldquo;weekly assignments\u0026rdquo; are actually designed to be completed during the class session.\n  You will need a computer for this class. If you need to borrow one please let me know.\n  I\u0026rsquo;m looking forward to seeing you all on Friday. There\u0026rsquo;s a light at the end of the tunnel\u0026hellip;we\u0026rsquo;ll get there together.\nExcelsior!\n","date":1536451200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"section","lang":"en","lastmod":1536451200,"objectID":"4cdd37113783e47641dd300543c94e1b","permalink":"https://BrunaLab.github.io/docs/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/docs/","section":"docs","summary":"The menu at left includes links to the course syllabus, instructor contact information, the course calendar, and the reading/videos for each course session.\nA quick word about the upcoming Spring 2022 Semester Like you I was optimistic all of this would be behind us by the start of this semester, but here we are.","tags":null,"title":"LAS 6292","type":"book"},{"authors":null,"categories":["R"],"content":"  R Markdown This is an R Markdown document.
