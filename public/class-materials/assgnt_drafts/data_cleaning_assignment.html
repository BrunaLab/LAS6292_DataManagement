<p>One of the goals this semester is to take a “messy” dataset, clean it, organize it, and – assuming you have permission – archive it in a repository. This assignment is the opportunity to show the how you moved from a “raw” dataset to a “clean” one.</p>
<p>For this assignment I need you to submit the following:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>The original raw dataset(s) (xls, csv, xlsx, txt, doc, other, list of photo or audio files).</p></li>
<li><p>A file of R code (.r) used to clean and reorganize the raw dataset (renaming columns, making corrections, the conversion of information in cells into codes, etc.).</p></li>
<li><p>The clean, correctly formatted, and properly named dataset(s) (ideally a csv or txt file; if your dataset is something else check with me in advance).</p></li>
</ol>
<p>I should be able to use your code to go from #1 to #3. Do not worry at all about what your code looks like. This is not a programming class – I do not care if the code is elegant, efficient, or sophisticated, only that it works. This tweet from Hadley Wickham, who wrote some of the most widely used and important R packages out there, says it all:</p>

<p>Please submit the assignment via e-learning. To submit the assignment, you can either (1) upload the three files or you can (2) provide a link to a folder where I can review the three files (e.g., on Dropbox, MS One Drive, etc.). You may have to invite me to review the folder; if so, you can use the address <a href="mailto:embruna@ufl.edu" class="email">embruna@ufl.edu</a>. If you have any issues just let me know.</p>
