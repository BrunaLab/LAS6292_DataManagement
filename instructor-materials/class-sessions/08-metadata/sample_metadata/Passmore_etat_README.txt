In each of our eight study sites we established a 100 m x 100 m plot in which we mapped all ant-plants and recorded the presence and identity of ant colonies in their domatia; vouchers of plants and ants were collected to confirm identifications.  For details on the survey and description of the field sites see: Bruna, E. M., H. L. Vasconcelos, and S. Heredia. 2005. The effect of habitat fragmentation on communities of mutualists: a test with Amazonian ants and their host plants. Biological Conservation 124(2005): 209-216.Column Headings:1) OBS: Each sample is given itÍs own ñObservation numberî for reference purposes. Range = 1-1057.2) Treatment: The type of habitat in which each sample was collected.  "CF" = Continuous Forest and "FF" = Forest Fragment3) Plot: The names for each plot followed by the treatment code. Plot names match those used in Passmore et al. 2012.4) Reserve: The code used by the BDDFP to identify each forest fragment or continuous forest reserve in which a plot is located.  Note that the Continuous Forest sites in Porto Alegre and Dimona are outside of the reserve boundaries, and hence do not have a reserve identification number.5) Replicate: Each habitat type (i.e., CF or FF) has four replicates numbered 1- 4.6) Plant_species: Codes for the species identity of each myrmecophytic plant recorded in the study plots, including those without an ant colony. Note that Myrcia madida was originally identified and reported in Bruna et al 2005 as Myrcia magna. In additional, juvenile individuals of Tachigali (Ts, N=16) could not be identified to species and hence were not used in the analyses presented in Passmore et al. 2012. Hm = Hirtella myrmecophila, Pr = Porouma spp., Hp = Hirtella physophora, Cn = Cordia nodosa, Ds = Duroia saccifera, Tm = Tachigali myrmecophila, Tv = Tachigali venusta, Mg = Maieta guianensis, Tb = Tococa bullifera, Mm = Myrcia madida, Cf = Cecropia focifolia, Ts = Tachigali spp, Cp = Cecropia purpurascens, Tp = Tachigali pumblea, Ag = Amaioua guianensis7) Ant_resident: Codes for the species or morphospecies identity of ants colonies found in each myrmecophyte recorded in our survey. Ad = Allomerus decemarticulatus, Ao = Allomerus octoarticulatus, As = Allomerus septemarticulatus, Az1 = Azteca sp 1, Az2 = Azteca sp 2, Az3 = Azteca sp 3, Az4 = Azteca sp 4, Az5 = Azteca sp 5, Az6 = Azteca sp 6, Azu = Azteca spp. (unidentified), Cb = Crematogaster brasiliensis, Cl = Crematogaster laevis, Cru = Crematogaster sp (unidentified), Cru = Crematogaster sp (unidentified), Cru = Crematogaster sp B, Clp = Crematogaster limata parabiotica, None = no ant resident, Pc = Pseudomyrmex concolor, Pn = Pseudomyrmex nigrescens, Pu = Pachycondyla unidentata, Pm = Pheidole minutula, Ph45 = Pheidole sp 45, Ph46 = Pheidole sp 46, Ph13 = Pheidole sp 13, Ph52 = Pheidole sp 52, Ph81 = Pheidole sp 81, Sl3 = Solenopsis sp 3, Me = Myrcidris epicharis, So12 = Solenopsis sp 12, So18 = Solenopsis sp 8, So3 = Solenopsis sp 3, Soa = Solenopsis sp A, So6 = Solenopsis sp 6, Ws = Wasmannia scrobifera, Wa = Wasmannia auropunctata, By2 = Brachymyrmex sp 2, By3 = Brachymyrmex sp 3, Doa = Dolichoderus sp A, Lt = Leptothorax tristani, Pa5 = Parathichina sp 5, Cab = Camponotus balzaniNote that some changes have been made to the ant classification and nomenclature since data were collected and presented in Bruna et al. 2005 as noted below.a. Changed spelling of all Allomerus octoarticulata to A. octoarticulatus.b. Changed spelling of all Allomerus septimarticulatus to A. septemarticulatus.c. The species Allomerus novemarticulatus was reclassified as A. octoarticulatus. Three records (OBS 5, 135 and 136) were corrected in this dataset.d. We treated Pheidole sp. 2 as P. minutula (OBS 127).e. We treated Crematogaster sp A and B in Tococa bullifera (OBS 302, 303, 304, 1041) as C. laevis (only C. laevis establishes colonies in these plants).f. In Passmore et al. 2012 all Azteca morphospecies were considered as a single taxon because of unresolved taxonomy of this group. Morphospecies names were left unchanged here for future reference.7) Classification_Ant: Identifies the resident ant as an obligate ant-plant species that nests only in the domatia of myrmecophytes or an opportunist that will occasional nest in ant-plants but provides no mutualist services.  Only obligate ant-plant residents were used in the analyses presented in Passmore et al. 2012.8) Height: Height of host plant in meters; in the case of plants with multiple stems it is the height of the tallest stem.
