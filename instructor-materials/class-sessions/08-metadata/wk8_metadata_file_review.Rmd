# **Breakout (40 min): ** How easy is it to find and understand metadata associated with papers?

## Instructions

Follow the links to these pages, where you will find the data and metadata from some previously published papers. Look over the data and metadata and discuss the following:

1. Can you explain the variables they collected?

2. Do the data and metadata appear to adhere to the FAIR Principles? 
  
    * Findable: persistent identifiers & basic machine-actionable metadata
    * Accessible: can be read by machines & humans
    * Interoperable: use shared vocabularies / ontologies, machine-accessible (meta)data
    * Re-Usable: descriptions allow others to reuse and link with other data sources


2. Did they include the 5 metadata descriptors?

    * Class I: alert potential secondary users to the existence of data sets that fall within specific temporal, spatial, and thematic domains. 
    * Class II: describe the research resulting in a data set. 
    * Class III: status of the data set and information on its accessibility. 
    * Class IV: all the attributes related to the structure of the data file. 
    * Class V: all other related information that might be necessary for secondary usage, publishing the data set, or auditing the data set. 

3. Does anything else stand out about the data metadata files?
