## CONSISTENCY = EFFICIENCY

- If multiple people are working on the same project, use a “style guide” to ensure consistency: headers, font, format, abbreviations, capitalization,  numbers

- Always indicate change in speaker

- Indicate time stamps at regular intervals, and when there is an inaudible portion

- Whatever you do, **_be consistent_**

- When in doubt, use Chicago Manual of Style

# TRANSCRIBING IS AN ART, NOT A SCIENCE!  

## Common issues:

- False starts
- Run-on sentences
- Non-verbals
- Dialects / Slang
- Filler words


<!-- <center><img src="/images/Slide19.png"  height="100%" width="100%"></center> -->
#
#### REMEMBER THE GOAL OF TRANSCRIPTION

- Should not embarrass the narrator or make them look foolish  
- Should capture the flavor of a narrator’s speech
- Should be clarified when appropriate with the use of brackets

[end of interview]

My grandfather is buried there [pointing out the window], under that oak tree.

I work in the DCC [Digital Collections Center]every day.
