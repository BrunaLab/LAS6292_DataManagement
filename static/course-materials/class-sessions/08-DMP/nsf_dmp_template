NSF DMP Headings. This plan is based on the "NSF-BIO: Biological Sciences" template provided by National Science Foundation (NSF) - (ver: 4, pub: 2018-04-24).

1. Data and Materials Produced

Describe the types of data, physical samples or collections, software, curriculum materials, and other materials to be produced in the course of the project. (For collaborative proposals, the DMP must cover all the various data types being collected by each collaborator.)


2. Standards, Formats and Metadata

Describe the standards to be used for all the data types anticipated, including data or file format and metadata.

3. Roles and Responsibilities

Describe the roles and responsibilities of all parties with respect to the management of the data (including contingency plans for the departure of key personnel from the project).


4. Dissemination Methods

Describe the dissemination methods that will be used to make data and metadata available to others during the period of the award, and any modifications or additional technical information regarding data access after the grant ends.


5. Policies for Data Sharing and Public Access

Describe the PIâ€™s policies for data sharing, public access and re-use, including re-distribution by others and the production of derivatives. Where appropriate, include provisions for protection of privacy, confidentiality, security, intellectual property rights and other rights.


6. Archiving, Storage and Preservation

Where relevant, describe plans for archiving data, samples, software, and other research products, and for on-going access to these products through their lifecycle of usefulness to research and education. Consider which data (or research products) will be deposited for long-term access and where. (What physical and/or cyber resources and facilities (including third party resources) will be used to store and preserve the data after the grant ends?)
