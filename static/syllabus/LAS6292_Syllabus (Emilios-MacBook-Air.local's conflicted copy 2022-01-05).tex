\textbf{1. Instructor:} Dr.~Emilio M. Bruna (he/him;
\url{http://brunalab.org/emilio-m-bruna/})

\textbf{2. Contact Information:} Phone: (352) 846-0634 \textbar{} email:
\href{mailto:embruna@ufl.edu}{\nolinkurl{embruna@ufl.edu}}

\textbf{3. Class sessions:} Friday, Periods 6-8 (12:50-3:50) in 376
Grinter Hall

\textbf{4. Office Hours:} Tuesday and Thursday 10:30 am -12:00 pm in the
Tropical Ecology \& Conservation Lab (directions at
\url{http://brunalab.org/contact-find-us/}) or via Zoom (the link is on
class canvas page). You can sign up for an appointment in advance here:
\url{http://brunalab.org/teaching/office-hours/}); you don't have to do
so, but it guarantees a specific time slot so you don't have to wait in
line.

\textbf{5. Course Objectives:} This course is a practical introduction
to methods, tools, and best practices for collecting, organizing,
managing, and visualizing qualitative and quantitative data. It is
designed for graduate students from all disciplines at any stage of
their program. \textbf{\emph{At the conclusion of the course students
will be able to}:}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Describe the different types of research data;
\item
  Explain the need for and benefits of data management and sharing;
\item
  Describe and implement best practices for the collection, storage,
  management, archiving, and sharing of research data;
\item
  Find, download, and analyze publicly available data from repositories;
\item
  Carry out simple and reproducible data corrections and data set
  organization;
\item
  Describe public policies and agency requirements for data management
  and sharing;
\item
  Articulate the major legal and ethical considerations regarding data
  collection, use, and storage (e.g., privacy/human subjects,
  intellectual property, international law);
\item
  Create and Implement Data Management Plan in funder-specific formats;
\item
  Identify and properly use tools for more efficient and secure data
  collection in the field.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{6. Course Format:} This course is taught (mostly) as an
active-learning workshop. Students are expected to complete reading or
watch some short video lectures prior class. The in-class session will
typically include an opportunity to ask questions about the pre-class
materials and for me to demonstrate challenging concepts; occasionally
there will be a class discussion about the reading. Most of the session,
however, will be spent working - sometimes in groups, sometimes
individually - on exercises that reinforce the session's concepts and
techniques. During class I will be circulating between groups to assist
with the assignment, work though mistakes, and discuss how the
techniques can be applied to your research.

\textbf{7. Course Materials:}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  \emph{Required Textbook:} \emph{None}. All readings will be provided
  online.
\item
  \emph{Course Web Page:} Course materials, communication, and
  assignment submission will be via Canvas
  (\url{https://elearning.ufl.edu}) and the class website
  (\url{https://las6292.netlify.app/}).

\subsection{ASSIGNMENTS \& EVALUATION}\label{assignments-evaluation}}

~\\
\textbf{The course grade is based on the completion of the following
assignments:}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  \emph{Weekly in-class exercises (700 points total}): 14 exercises x 50
  points each. Most of the in-class assignments involve hands-on
  practice with data collection or manipulation. In some weeks, however,
  assignment will be the submission of questions for group discussion or
  brief reflection on the issues from the readings. Most in-class
  assignments are designed to be completed during the class session, but
  to ensure students master the concepts rather than rush through them
  \emph{they can be submitted anytime until 9 am the following Monday}.
\item
  \emph{Data Management Plan (200 points)}: due no later than 5 pm on 1
  April 2022
\item
  \emph{Individual Data Cleanup Project (600 points)}: due no later than
  5 pm on 29 April 2022 (scheduled date of the final exam).
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Final Grades:} Course grades will be based on the percentage of
1300 total points earned and will be assigned with the following scale:
A: \textgreater93\% A-: 92-90\% B+: 89-87\% B: 86-83\% B-: 82-80\% C+:
79-77\% C: 76-73\% C-: 72-70\% D+: 69-67\% D-: 62-60\% E: 59\% and
below.

\textbf{Regrades: } Requests for re-evaluation of any quizzes, exams, or
assignments will only be considered if accompanied by a letter
explaining why you think you deserve additional credit and the number of
additional points you think you deserve. The deadline for submitting
these requests is one week after the work has been returned.

\subsection{CLASS ATTENDANCE \& PARTICIPATION
POLICIES}\label{class-attendance-participation-policies}}

\hypertarget{attendance}{%
\subsubsection{\texorpdfstring{\textbf{Attendance}}{Attendance}}\label{attendance}}

Requirements for class attendance and make-up exams, assignments, and
other work in this course are consistent with university policies that
can be found at
\url{https://catalog.ufl.edu/UGRD/academic-regulations/attendance-policies/}.
Though attendance is not required, most of the required assignments are
completed in class. They are designed so that one could complete them
independently, but by doing them in class you will benefit from working
collaboratively with the other students.

\hypertarget{participation}{%
\subsubsection{\texorpdfstring{\textbf{Participation}}{Participation}}\label{participation}}

Consistent informed, thoughtful, and considerate class participation is
encouraged. If you have personal issues that prohibit you from joining
freely in class discussion, e.g., shyness, language barriers, etc., that
is no problem! Let me know me as soon as possible and we will discuss
alternative modes of participation. \textbf{\emph{If you need to miss an
upcoming class for whatever reason (e.g., conference, illness, family
emergency), please let me know as soon as possible.}} We will make
arrangements for you to complete any assignments and go over any
material you will be missing. I would much rather you focus on your
health or supporting friends and family in need than struggle to turn in
assignments.

\hypertarget{in-class-recording}{%
\subsubsection{\texorpdfstring{\textbf{In-Class
Recording}}{In-Class Recording}}\label{in-class-recording}}

\textbf{Students are allowed to record video or audio of class lectures.
However, the purposes for which these recordings may be used are
strictly controlled.} The only allowable purposes are (1) for personal
educational use, (2) in connection with a complaint to the university,
or (3) as evidence in, or in preparation for, a criminal or civil
proceeding. All other purposes are prohibited. Specifically, students
may not publish recorded lectures without the written consent of the
instructor.

\textbf{\emph{A ``class lecture'' is:}} an educational presentation
intended to inform or teach enrolled students about a particular
subject, including any instructor-led discussions that form part of the
presentation, and delivered by any instructor hired or appointed by the
University, or by a guest instructor, as part of a University of Florida
course. A class lecture does not include lab sessions, student
presentations, clinical presentations such as patient history, academic
exercises involving solely student participation, assessments (quizzes,
tests, exams), field trips, private conversations between students in
the class or between a student and the faculty or lecturer during a
class session.

\textbf{\emph{Publication without permission of the instructor is
prohibited.}}To ``publish'' means to share, transmit, circulate,
distribute, or provide access to a recording, regardless of format or
medium, to another person (or persons), including but not limited to
another student within the same class section. Additionally, a
recording, or transcript of a recording, is considered published if it
is posted on or uploaded to, in whole or in part, any media platform,
including but not limited to social media, book, magazine, newspaper,
leaflet, or third-party note/tutoring services. A student who publishes
a recording without written consent may be subject to a civil cause of
action instituted by a person injured by the publication and/or
discipline under UF Regulation 4.040 Student Honor Code and Student
Conduct Code
