## Class Outline

```{r timer, echo=FALSE}
intro_break <- 20
intro_break_convo <- 30
data_cycle_intro <- 15
snack_break <- 10
data_break <- 20
data_break_convo <- 20
class_overview <- 15

total_time <- intro_break + intro_break_convo + 
  data_cycle_intro + snack_break + class_overview + data_break + 
  data_break_convo

time_remain <- 180 - total_time
```

1. Turn on zoom captioning 

1. **Block 1: (`r intro_break + intro_break_convo` total): ** ----- **(`r intro_break` min)**. We will then come back to ---- **(`r intro_break_convo` min)**.  


3. **Block 2: Instructor Presentation (`r data_cycle_intro` min): **

      1. item
      2. item

6. **`r snack_break` min BREAK **

7.  **Block 3: Next section/breakout (`r data_break + data_break_convo` min)** . explain, group members have **`r data_break` min** to discuss the following questions. We'll come back and  discuss what you came up with for as a group **(`r data_break_convo` min)**.

8. **Instructor presentation: ====== (`r class_overview` min) ** topic or explanation

9. **Time Remaining: In-class assignment 1 (`r time_remain` min**)

    * Sign up for a Dropbox account 
    * Sign up for a UFL Google Account
    * Write up a data backup plan
    * Save files in one of these with properly formatted names
    * Submit a screenshot of the system / name
    * Submit Data backup plan
 
## After class: 

* Be sure you complete and submit the assignment by 9 am Monday  
* Prepare for next session (assigned reading, videos, etc).






Alternative Questions: 

    * How might you organize a time series of photos from several remote cameras?  Possibility 1: images from each camera are in different folders. These are, in turn, collected in a folder named "images". Each folder would be named with the identifier for the camera. The file names for images might reflect the time the image was taken.
