"Identify, describe, and explain the basic concepts, theories and terminology of natural science and the scientific method; the major scientific discoveries and the impacts on society and the environment; and the relevant processes that govern biological and physical systems.","Identify, describe, and explain the cross-disciplinary dimensions of a pressing societal issue or challenge as represented by the social sciences and/or biophysical sciences incorporated into the course.","Identify, describe, and explain the patterns of rain forest biodiversity at multiple spatial scales, the evolutionary and ecological mechanisms underlying the evolution and maintenance of this biodiversity, historical and geographical variation in how humans use and alter rain forests, and the social, economic, and biological consequences of these activities.","Class-based exercises and activities, summaries and interpretations of scientific papers."
Formulate empirically-testable hypotheses derived from the study of physical processes or living things; apply logical reasoning skills effectively through scientific criticism and argument; and apply techniques of discovery and critical thinking effectively to solve scientific problems and to evaluate outcomes.,"Critically analyze quantitative or qualitative data appropriate for informing an approach, policy, or praxis that addresses some dimension of an important societal issue or challenge.","Gather, Analyze, and Interpret multidisciplinary data to document geographic variation in deforestation and test hypotheses and test hypotheses regarding the underlying socioeconomic drivers and biological consequences.",Class-based exercises and activities in wihc they are required to Formulate empirically-testable hypotheses and evaluate them with data the gather and analyze.
"Communicate scientific knowledge, thoughts, and reasoning clearly and effectively.","Develop and present, in terms accessible to an educated public, clear and effective responses to proposed approaches, policies, or practices that address important societal issues or challenges.",Develop and communicate materials describing the value of rain forests and their biodiversity for local university students and concrete actions individuals can take to promote their sustainability.,"Summaries of scientific papers and discussions of the results and implications, presentations of final projects"
,"Connect course content with critical reflection on their intellectual, personal, and professional development at UF and beyond.","Reflect on course content and connect on how the results of biological research and the issues they have studied relate to their personal values and professional ambitions, and how this will influence their choices and behaviors at UF and beyond.",Personal reflections on their use of and dependence on tropical biodiversity and the actions they can take as citizens and consumers to promote forest conservation.
