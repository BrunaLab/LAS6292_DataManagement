# The Future of Rain Forests

## IDS 2935 - Quest 2 - Fall 2022
\vspace{0.6cm} 
\newpage 

```{r, echo=FALSE, results='asis'}

```

Tropical rain forests cover ~ 15% of the Earth’s land surface but contain over 50% of the world’s biodiversity. They are also the home to millions of people, the source of products central to our lives, shape global climate, and are being cleared at unprecedented rates. Students in this class will investigate the same fundamental questions asked by researchers studying rain forests: Why are we fascinated by tropical rain forests? What gave rise to their remarkable biodiversity? How have stereotypes about them permeated everything from pop culture to international relations? What are the national and international drivers and consequences of deforestation? Is forest conservation compatible with socioeconomic development? Because these questions and their answers are inherently multidisciplinary, the course will include content from the humanities, social sciences, and biophysical sciences. While the course focuses on tropical countries, a central theme of the course is exploring the individual, local, national, and global impacts of tropical rain forests in an increasingly interconnected world.
