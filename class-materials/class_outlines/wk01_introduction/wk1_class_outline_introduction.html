<li><p><strong>Block 1: Breakout for Introductions (45 total): </strong> Get to know one another! Get in pairs, introduce yourselves, and record responses to the following questions <strong>(20 min)</strong>. We will then come back to introduce your partner to the group <strong>(25 min)</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Tell me about yourself: </strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Name</li>
<li>In what city were you born?</li>
<li>What you consider your “hometown”?</li>
<li>Program and Degree?</li>

<li>Hobbies or what you do to relax.</li>
<li>What is your motivation for taking this class?</li>
<li>Any concerns / worries / fears about this class (in particular) and this semester (in general)?</li>
</ol></li>
<li><p><strong>Once you are done with the introductions, come up with an answer to the following question: </strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>What are ‘Data’?</li>

<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Students take turns introducing themselves</li>
<li>Quick summary of the different ways they defined “data”</li>
</ol></li>
<li><p><strong>Block 3: Instructor Presentation - EB Motivation for Teaching Course (20 min): </strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>The defintion of “Data”</li>
<li>EB Motivation for teaching the class:
<ul>
<li>Reduce Student Stress</li>
<li>Research integrity: identifies fraud, a shield to protect you when you are right</li>
<li>Because it really matters to society, both when we get it wrong and when we get it right</li>
<li>Because your data are a potential gold mine for future researchers…but only if you take a few important steps now.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Prompt for the next breakout (to start after break); Breakout into larger groups (n = 4)</li>
</ol></li>
<li><p><strong>10 min BREAK </strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Block 3: ‘Data’ across disciplines Breakout (45 min)</strong> . Now that data have been defined, group members have <strong>25 min</strong> to discuss the following questions. We’ll come back and discuss what you came up with for as a group <strong>(20 min)</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li>Discussion Questions:
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Identify different kinds of data collected in different disciplines</li>
<li>How are these data gathered (tools, techniques) and recorded (media)?</li>
</ol></li>
<li>After each group reports back, discuss the following questions as a group:
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Are data types and data recording methods that are unique (or at least much more common) in the biophysical sciences, social sciences, humanities, or other disciplines?<br />
</li>
<li>It is likely that across disciplines the issues and types of data being used are often very similar, but there might be some differences (e.g., text corpora from humanities).</li>
<li>One key is to emphasize that an important part of ‘data’ likely not brought up by the groups is information about how they were recorded, decisions about how to code them, corrections, etc.</li>
<li>Important: look to see if the definitions include the word “PLAN”: managing data requires a PLAN. This will let you segway into…</li>
</ol></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Instructor presentation: Research Data Cycle &amp; Syllabus Overview (20 min)</strong></p>
<p>1.Typical vs. New approach to Data
2.Most courses start with the most boring part: DMP. I take an approach different from many other data manag classes.
3.Introduce Assignments and Format of Weekly Sessions. This is a workshop!
4.<em>This course is driven by student needs and interests! </em>The syllabus may change as I learn more about those.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Time Remaining: In-class assignment 1 (40 min</strong>)</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Please complete the survey in Canvas (under “Assignments: Week 1 Survey”)</li>
</ol></li>
