MetadataElevated pCO2 affects tissue biomass composition, but not calcification, in a reef coral under two light regimesC.B. Wall, R.A.B. Mason, W.R. Ellis, R. Cunning, R.D. GatesPhysiological data for Pocillopora acuta fragments exposed to 32 d of pCO2 and light treatments. Colonies were collected 13 and 29 October 2014 at ~ 1 m from a reef adjacent to the Hawai‘i Institute of Marine Biology in K?ne‘ohe Bay, O‘ahu, Hawai‘i (21°26’08.9”N, 157°47’12.0”W).ColumnsDate = day of sample processing in dd/mm/yyTank = replicate experimental tanks for each orthogonal treatment conditionsCO2 = carbon dioxide (CO2) gas addition to seawater treatment, either ambient partial pressure CO2 (ACO2, mean = 435 ?atm pCO2) or high (HCO2, 957 ?atm pCO2)Light = light treatment, either low light (LL, 7.5 mol photons m-2 d-1) or high light (15.7 mol photons m-2 d-1)Treatment = orthogonal combination of light-pCO2 treatments. LL–AC = low light-ambient pCO2, LL–HC = low light-high pCO2, HL–AC = high light-ambient pCO2, HL–HC = high light-high pCO2Temperature = seawater temperature in degrees CelsiusSalinity = salinity of seawater within experimental tanks measured by YSI conductivity meter
