# Assignments overview  
&nbsp;  

## Weekly In-class activities

Most of the in-class assignments involve hands-on practice with data collection or manipulation. In some weeks, however, assignment will be the submission of questions for group discussion or brief reflection on the issues from the readings. Most in-class assignments are designed to be completed during the class session, but to ensure students master the concepts rather than rush through them *they can be submitted anytime until 9 am the following Monday*.

## Data Cleaning Project

This project is an opportunity to put some of the lessons learned into practice with a data set of your own. Your assignment is to **(1)** clean and organize a 'messy' data set and prepare metadata describing the resulting 'clean' data. The complete project requires the submission of these three items via the course Canvas website: 

(1) R code that imports, cleans, and organizes, and saves 'messy' data (please make sure I have access to the original 'messy' data by either providing a link or the data themselves. If these data cannot be shared because of privacy / confidentiality concerns please let me know in advance so we can arrange an alternative means for me to review them);  
(2) The resulting 'clean' (i.e., corrected and organized) data in an appropriate format (e.g., .csv, .txt).   
(3) Metadata describing the corrected data set (This can either be in the form of the link to a github repository or the submissio of a file in .txt or .pdf format).  

**Due Date & Point Value:** The assignment is due **30 April 2021** by 5 pm and is worth **650 points**

Complete details regarding the project - including deadlines and grading rubrics - can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/viewer?url=https://github.com/BrunaLab/EmilioMBruna_CV/raw/main/EmilioMBruna_CV.pdf). 


## DMP for Thesis Research

The Data Management Plan (DMP) is a critical document describing the data to be collected for a research project, how it will be stored and managed, and the investigator with primary responsibility for its management. Many funding agencies, including NSF and NIH, now require a DMP with all grant applications. Each student will prepare a Data Management Plan (DMP) for their thesis research. The assignment, deadline, and evaluation rubric are available [here]().
