**Welcome to LAS 6292: Data Collection & Management for Latin American Studies.** The menu at left includes links to the course syllabus, instructor contact information, the course calendar, and the reading/videos for each course session.


1. Class will be meeting on Friday in 376 Grinter Hall. There are no assignments or reading that need to be done in advance of the first session.  

1. Your health and safety are my first priority; I encourage you to follow the UF recommendation to get vaccinated against COVID19 and wear an N95 mask in class if you wish to do so.  

1. You will need a computer for this class. If you need to borrow one please let me know.  

1. The zoom link for office hours can be found on the class Canvas page. If you have any problems logging on you can send me a message.  

1. I'm working to make the class as "flipped" as possible, and also developing an online version of the course. After the first session, most of the remaining weeks will have the following format:  

      * _Before class:_ Watch videos and read assigned texts introducing the session's topic

      * _During Class:_ hands-on work and in-class exercises to apply the lessons learned (with submission of some materials for review)

      * _After class:_ finish any exercises not completed during class time, prepare for the next session.

      * Occasionally there might be some short lectures to better cover challenging material, and there are a few days where we will have a class discussion of the reading.

1. I've tried to keep the time commitments, reading, and assignments to a minimum.  The "weekly assignments" are actually designed to be completed during the class session. 


I'm looking forward to seeing you all on the first day of class.
