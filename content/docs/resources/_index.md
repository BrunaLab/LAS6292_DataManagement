## R Programming

### Essential

1. Hadley Wickham wrote a book on using the tidyverse and the [online version is FREE](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/). This is a phenomenal resource on using R to import, tidy, and visualize data. 

2. [Posit Cheat Sheets](https://posit.co/resources/cheatsheets/): help with commands for using the different `tidyverse` packages, RStudio shortcuts and tricks, help with R commands, and more. You definitely want the ones for Data Import, Work with Strings, Factors, Data Transformation, and Base R.

3. Where and How to ask for help  

    * Hadley Wickham's advice on [how to write a good reproducible  
    example]((http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Reproducibility.html)) for getting help with R  
    * [how to post good questions on StackOverflow](https://www.r-bloggers.com/2011/01/three-tips-for-posting-good-questions-to-r-help-and-stack-overflow/)  
    * The UF [R-users listserv](http://www.r-gators.com/listserv/) is *very* user friendly and a great place to post requests for help.

5. Kieran Healy's [*Data Visualization: a practical introduction*](https://socviz.co/) is my favorite introductory (yet super-comprehensive) book on data visualization with R. If you scroll down to the bottom of the page you can download the datasets and code used to make the figures in the book, which makes life much easier.
