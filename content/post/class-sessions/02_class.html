<!-- # **LAS 6292 WEEK 2 ASSIGNMENT: Data Storage and Backup**  -->
<div id="breakout-exercise-field-data-storage-and-backup" class="section level2">
<h2>BREAKOUT EXERCISE: FIELD DATA STORAGE AND BACKUP</h2>
<p>Robin is a graduate student studying Malaria in Tanzania. The research project requires visiting communities, collecting mosquitoes from different sources of standing water (for later identification at the FLMNH and statistical analyses of mosquito diversity and abundance) and conducting semi–structured interviews in the community, where people are asked such things as their age, family income, their access to health care, if they have ever had malaria, their family income, use of mosquito nets. Answers are recorded on data sheets, but the interviews are also recorded with the cell phone for later transcription. Robin also takes pictures of houses to document standing water sources. Throughout the day Robin records observations in a notebook.</p>
<p>Robin is staying in a house where there is electricity for a laptop. Once every two weeks Robin goes into town, where there is usually good internet access at the university.</p>
<p>What steps should Robin take in the field to safeguard the data collected in the field?</p>

<h3>Data Protection &amp; Backup Plan</h3>
<p><strong>This week’s assignment is designed to:</strong> <strong>(A)</strong> get you thinking critically about your own data backup and security procedures, and based on that reflection <strong>(B)</strong> prepare a data backup plan (if you already have one you can answer the questions below based on that plan). <strong>The assignment comes in four parts:</strong></p>
