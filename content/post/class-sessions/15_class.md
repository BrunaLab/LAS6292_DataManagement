# Data, Ethics, & The Law

### Before we start...

- [an example from our lab](https://github.com/BrunaLab/bdffpRain/issues/27) of a real data clean-up situation for which OpenRefine is ideal


### Part 1: Anonymizing is hard

**Exercise 1:** Finalize this "anonymization log' for one of your interviews. How would you anonymize each entry? 


| **Interview-Page** | **Original Info** | **Changed to** |
| ---     | ---   | ---     |
| Int1 p1 | Age: 27 | "______________" |
| Int1 p1 | Born in Venezeula | "______________" |
| Int1 p2 | Born on 20 June | "______________" |
| Int1 p2 | Name: Miguel | "______________" |
| Int1 p3 | Lives in Atlanta | "______________" |
| Int1 p4 | Known as 'Tio Miguelito | "______________" |
| Int2 p1 | his friend Maria | "______________" |
| Int2 p8 | attended Talbot Elementary School | "______________" |
| Int2 p10 | Director, Southern Region, Quantum Vehicles | "______________" |
| Int2 p11 | lives in Grant Park | "______________" |



**Exercise 2:** [Download this interview file](https://las6292.netlify.app/uploads/exercises/corti_03_exercise_8.1_original_answer.docx) to your computer. Try anonymizing this text - was it harder or easier than the more abstract list above? Why or why not?

### PART 2: Research misconduct related to data

Take 15 minutes to read this article: Martinson, B., Anderson, M. & de Vries, R. 2005. Scientists behaving badly. Nature 435:737â€“738. [link](https://doi.org/10.1038/435737a). Then then go to the class Canvas page and tell the class what you thought of the paper. In particular: 

  * Did the % of scientists engaging in the different behaviors surprise you, and 
  * Are all the behaviors equally 'bad'? Are there cases (or disciplinary norms) in which they might be acceptable?
