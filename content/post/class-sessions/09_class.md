## Efficient Data Collection

### Breakout: Process Audit of Data Forms

  1. Look over the forms handed out in class and conduct a process audit. 
  2. _Where_ and _why_ do you think errors are most likely to sneak in? 
  3. Summarize your conclusions and prepare to present them to the class.

### Break

### Assignment: Data Sheet UX

Now lets implement some of the things we've learned. 
1. Conduct a Process Audit of your personal data collection sheet. (If you do not have one of your own, you can do the assignment with the "Line Transect Sheet‚Äù used in class)
2. Redo your paper data sheet based on your process audit
3. Create an electronic version of the data sheet using Google Forms
4. When done, submit the following via canvas:

    * the original form
    * the revised form
    * A link to the google form

<!--- Alt Option: Research Checklist Generation ---->

### Grading Rubric: 

**50:** Ways errors can get incorporated have been identified; revised form and google doc use UI/UX principles to reduce most data recording errors. 
**35:** Some (but not all) ways that errors can get incorporated have been identified; revised form and google doc use UI/UX principles to reduce some of the potential data recording errors. 
**20:** Few of the ways errors can be included are identified; data collection still likely to be error-prone and inefficient.
