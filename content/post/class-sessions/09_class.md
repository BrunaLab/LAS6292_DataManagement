# Introduction - DMPs

Today in class we will start drafting the DMP assigned as part of your semester project. To do so we will use the DMP tool, to which we have access as UF Researchers. If you are unfamiliar with DMPs, why they are important, and the information that typically goes into them, be sure to review the [General Guidance on DMPs](https://dmptool.org/general_guidance) before starting today's exercise.

1. Sign in to the [DMP Tool](https://dmptool.org) using Option 1 ("If your institution is affiliated with DMPTool"). If you have trouble refer to the  [DMP Quick	Start	Guide](https://dmptool.org/help). 

2. Click the Link or Button for "Create a Plan". 

3. Start filling in the three boxes. (It's that easy). _For today's exercise be sure to check the box for "mock project for testing, practice, or educational purposes"_

4. The hard work is thinking through **all** of the data you will be collecting during your thesis, how you will collect it, how much of it there will be, what format it will be in, how you will store it...It's best to start by making a list off-line rather than expecting to remember it all at this moment, so...

5. ...I have created txt versions of the questions for the NEH and NSF DMPs, as well as a Generic DMP. You can download these below and work on them off-line.


    **a. NEH DMP:** {{% staticref "course-materials/class-sessions/08-DMP/neh_dmp_template.txt" "newtab" %}}[.txt format]{{% /staticref %}} or {{% staticref "course-materials/class-sessions/08-DMP/neh_dmp_template.Rmd" "newtab" %}}[.Rmd format]{{% /staticref %}}


    **b. NSF DMP:** {{% staticref "course-materials/class-sessions/08-DMP/nsf_dmp_template.txt" "newtab" %}}[.txt format]{{% /staticref %}} or {{% staticref "course-materials/class-sessions/08-DMP/nsf_dmp_template.Rmd" "newtab" %}}[.Rmd format]{{% /staticref %}}

    **c. Generic DMP**: {{% staticref "course-materials/class-sessions/08-DMP/generic_dmp_template.txt" "newtab" %}}[.txt format]{{% /staticref %}} or {{% staticref "course-materials/class-sessions/08-DMP/generic_dmp_template.Rmd" "newtab" %}}[.Rmd format]{{% /staticref %}}
    
# Sample DMPs

The Notes for this session have sample DMPs from different disciplines you can use as models for your projects, as well as many other resources for preparing DMPs.
