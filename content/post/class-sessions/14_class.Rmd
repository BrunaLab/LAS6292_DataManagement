## In-Class Exercise: Data, Ethics, & the Law

### PART 1: Anonymizing is hard

1. Exercise 1: Finalize this "anonymization log' for one of your interviews. How would you anonymiuze each entry? 


```{r anon_log, echo=FALSE}
library(knitr)
library(kableExtra)
library(tidyverse)

col1<-c(
"Int1 p1",
"Int1 p1",
"Int1 p2",
"Int1 p2",
"Int1 p3",
"Int1 p4",
"Int2 p1",
"Int2 p8",
"Int2 p10",
"Int2 p11"
)

col2<-c(
"Age: 27",
"Born in Venezeula",
"Born on 20 June",
"Name: Miguel",
"Lives in Atlanta",
"Known as 'Tio Miguelito'",
"his friend Maria",
"attended Talbot Elementary School",
"Director, Southern Region, Quantum Vehicles",
"lives in Grant Park"
)

col3<-c(
" ",
" ",
" ",
" ",
" ",
" ",
" ",
" ",
" ",
" "
)

log<-data_frame(col1,col2,col3)
names(log)<-c("Interview-Page","Original Info", "Changed to")

log %>%
  kbl() %>%
  kable_styling(latex_options = "HOLD_position")
```


2. Exercise 2: [Download this interview file](https://github.com/BrunaLab/LAS6292_DataManagement/blob/70a15b1b37357f7dabc4a3c77787cca308d2ba18/static/course-materials/class-sessions/14-legal-ethical/in-class_resources/corti_03_exercise_8.1_original_answer.docx) by clicking the 'download" button and saving to your computer. Try anonymizing this text - was it harder or easier than the more abstract list above? Why or why not?


### PART 2: Research misconduct related to data

1. Take 15 minutes to read this article: Martinson, B., Anderson, M. & de Vries, R. 2005. Scientists behaving badly. Nature 435:737â€“738. [link](https://doi.org/10.1038/435737a). We'll come back and discuss it as a group aftyer the break.
