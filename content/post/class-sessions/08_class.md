# Introduction - DMPs

Today's in class we will start drafting the DMP assigned as part of your semester project. To do so we will use the DMP tool, to which we have access as UF Researchers.

1. Log on to the DMP

* The [DMP Tool](https://dmptool.org), [Quick	Start	Guide](http://dmptool.org/quickstartguide), and [Help](https://dmptool.org/help)

2. Chose the type of DMP you would like to prepare.

3. Start filling in Boxes. It's that easy.

4. The hard work is thinking through **all** of the data you will be collecting during your thesis, how you will collect it, how much of it there will be, what format it will be in, how you will store it...It's best to start by making a list off-line rather than expecting to remember it all at this moment, so...

5. ...I have created txt versions of the questions for the NEH and NSF DMPs, as well as a Generic DMP. You can download these below and work on them off-line.

**a. NEH DMP:** {{% staticref "course-materials/class-sessions/08-DMP/neh_dmp_headings.txt" "newtab" %}}[Download in .txt format]{{% /staticref %}} | {{% staticref "course-materials/class-sessions/08-DMP/neh_dmp_headings.Rmd" "newtab" %}}[Download in .Rmd format]{{% /staticref %}}

**b. NSF DMP:** {% staticref "course-materials/class-sessions/08-DMP/nsf_dmp_headings.txt" "newtab" %}}[Download in .txt format]{{% /staticref %}} | {{% staticref "course-materials/class-sessions/08-DMP/nsf_dmp_headings.Rmd" "newtab" %}}[Download in .Rmd format]{{% /staticref %}}

**c. Generic DMP**: {{% staticref "course-materials/class-sessions/08-DMP/generic_dmp_headings.txt" "newtab" %}}[Download in .txt format]{{% /staticref %}} | {{% staticref "course-materials/class-sessions/08-DMP/generic_dmp_headings.Rmd" "newtab" %}}[Download in .Rmd format]{{% /staticref %}}


# Sample DMPs

The Notes for this session have sample DMPs from different disciplines you can use as models for your projects.
