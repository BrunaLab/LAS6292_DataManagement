## Metadata & Codebooks



#### **1. Review of Other Researchers' Metadata**
     
### **Break**

#### **2. Getting Started on your own Metadata**

### Metadata Templates

Today's session is an opportunity to start drafting the metadata for your project. Although there are links in the notes for today's sesssion to tools that will build your metadata in machine-readable XML schema, for this class (and maybe even in most cases) a .txt or .Rmd file with information on the relevant Class Descriptors (*sensu* Michener _et al._ 1997) is all you need sufficient. To save you time, I have created metadata templates based on information from ICSPR (for social sciences) and Michener _et al._ (for biophysical sciences) that you can download and edit; you can add more fields or delete any that are not relevant. Note that Table 1 in Michener _et al._ is much more comprehensive and provides additional guidance on how to make sure the metadata are useful.  

#### Workflow: 

1. Download the following templates: Click the link for your preferred format (.xtx or .Rmd) and save the file in the RStudio project you've created for your Course Project. The .txt version can be opened and edited in any word processor, a text editor, or in R. The .Rmd file is an R Markdown Document.  

      a. **Metadata Template for Social Sciences:** {{% staticref "course-materials/class-sessions/07-metadata/ICPSR_Metadata.txt" "newtab" %}}[.txt format]{{% /staticref %}} or {{% staticref "course-materials/class-sessions/07-metadata/ICPSR_Metadata.Rmd" "newtab" %}}[.Rmd format]{{% /staticref %}} (from ICSPR; see note below for additional info on Qualitative Data).  
      
      b. **Metadata template for Biophysical Sciences**: {{% staticref "course-materials/class-sessions/07-metadata/ICPSR_Metadata.txt" "newtab" %}}[.txt format]{{% /staticref %}} or {{% staticref "course-materials/class-sessions/07-metadata/ICPSR_Metadata.Rmd" "newtab" %}}[.Rmd format]{{% /staticref %}}(Table 1 from Michener et al. 1997).  
      
      c. **_Note for researchers in the Humanities or those working primarily with Qualitative Data:_** The metadata required often depend on the type of material with which you work (e.g., oral history, photos, digital, printed). If your data is in this domain, you can download templates here: [Template No.1](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1x98TWee85Gq9oas90JJYtB5DyPBkMSNEs29Mb1qyAeQ/edit#gid=0) is from UF's Samuel Proctor Oral History Project, [Template #2](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1K9RRNWrWbK0ikQai4_baBmxobqsX6jwEsiAHVjEJRDE/edit#gid=1745662283) is a more general one from the UF Humanities Archives. You can also review the [metadata required by the Qualitative Data Repository](https://qdr.syr.edu/content/qdr-metadata-application-profile).   
      

2. Choose the template that is most appropriate for your discipline, then review both templates.  Is there metadata from the other one would be useful to include in yours? If so, copy the items over and save the revised file with a new (correctly styled) name.

3. Start filling out the metadata requested in the template. You might want to begin by making notations on the ones for which you will have to present the range of possible values, units, the names / brands / models of equipment used to make or record measurments, etc.

4. **Submission:** NONE. This is a component of the final project, so the goal for today is to jump-start your work and to realize that preparing a good metadata file takes longer than anyone anticipates. 

**_Note:_** Be sure to check the Notes for today's topic - they include excellent resources for preparing metadata.
