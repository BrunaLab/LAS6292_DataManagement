# Automated Data Extraction


# Learning R Markdown

>> "When you knit the document, R Markdown sends the .Rmd file to knitr, http://yihui.name/knitr/, which executes all of the code chunks and creates a new markdown (.md) document which includes the code and its output. The markdown file generated by knitr is then processed by pandoc, http://pandoc.org/, which is responsible for creating the finished file. The advantage of this two step workflow is that you can create a very wide range of output formats""

## Tutorials 

 - HW's tutorial is [here](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/r-markdown.html)
 - a [PC-specific tutorial](https://medium.com/@sorenlind/create-pdf-reports-using-r-r-markdown-latex-and-knitr-on-windows-10-952b0c48bfa9)
 - a [MacOS specific tutorial](https://medium.com/@sorenlind/create-pdf-reports-using-r-r-markdown-latex-and-knitr-on-macos-high-sierra-e7b5705c9fd) 

## Install the following packages: 

- `bookdown`
- `knitr`

### If you want to render to pdf, you will also need to install some additional tools: 

- [Pandoc](https://github.com/jgm/pandoc/releases). After installation, you should add the path of the Pandoc executable to the system PATH.
- a TeX distribution. For PC You can use [TeX Live](https://www.tug.org/texlive/) or [MiKTeX](https://miktex.org/download); for [MacTeX](https://tug.org/mactex/mactex-download.html) base on your platform. 
- just in case, here is [TexShop](https://pages.uoregon.edu/koch/texshop/)

- note: TeX Live is designed to be cross-platform (running on Unix, MacOS, and Windows), MacTeX includes Mac-specific utilities and front-ends (such as TeXShop and BibDesk).
