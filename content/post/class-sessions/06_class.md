## QA/QC 2: Using OpenRefine to clean data

OpenRefine is a powerful, free, and open source tool that is used to work with and clean messy data.  We will be working through some of OpenRefine's basic features, after which you will trying them onm your own on a new data set.

**_Notes:_**

1. This is the url for accessing OpenRefine if a new tab/window doesn't open: http://127.0.0.1:3333/

2. To download the data file for the tutorial to your computer [click this link](https://ndownloader.figshare.com/files/11502815). (url: https://ndownloader.figshare.com/files/11502815)

## **Assignment**

Now it's your turn. Use Open Refine to clean up this data set. After you create a Project, edit the data as follows:

1. Correct and standardize the names of the countries in which the rodents were captured. 

2. The column `scientificName` contains two pieces of information (the Genus _and_ species of each animal). Split this into two columns, rename them as `genus` and `species`, and then correct and standardize the data in each column as needed. NB: You may run into an obstacle when you try to rename the columns. How can you get around it?

3. Save the clean data as a CSV file on your desktop.

4. Extract and save your steps (i.e., 'operation history' as JSON. Save this as a text file. 

5. _Bonus Brainteaser:_ Many of the cells in the column for the Latin bonomial are blank. How might you go about filling them in based on the column with the abbreviation?

6. **Submission:** Submit your clean .csv and the JSON text file as `week6_hw` on Canvas.  

### Grading Rubric: 

Data corrected and JSON file can be used on another data set: 50  
Most data correction properly programmed; some require instructor follow-up: 40  
Many of the corrections missing, JSON file unable to process new data : 30  
Instructor follow-up required to implement most changes: 20
