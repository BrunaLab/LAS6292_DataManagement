<h3><strong>Block 2: Instructor: Motivation for Teaching This Course (20 min): </strong></h3>
<!--       1. The defintion of "Data" -->
<!--       2. EB Motivation for teaching the class:  -->
<!--           * Reduce Student Stress -->
<!--           * Research integrity: identifies fraud, a shield to protect you when you are right -->
<!--           * Because it really matters to society, both when we get it wrong and when we get it right -->
<!--           * Because your data are a potential gold mine for future researchers...but only if you take a few important steps now. -->
<!--       2. Prompt for the next breakout (to start after break); Breakout into larger groups (n = 4) -->

<h3><strong>Block 3: ‘Data’ across disciplines Breakout</strong> (45 min total)</h3>
<p>Now that data have been defined, we will break into small groups to discuss the following questions (<strong>25 min</strong>). We’ll come back and discuss what you came up with for as a group <strong>(20 min)</strong>.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Identify different kinds of data collected in different disciplines</li>
<li>How are these data gathered (tools, techniques) and recorded (media)?</li>
</ol>
<!-- After each group reports back, discuss the following questions as a group: -->
<!-- 1. Are data types and data recording methods that are unique (or at least much more common) in the biophysical sciences, social sciences, humanities, or other disciplines?  -->
<!-- 2. It is likely that across disciplines the issues and types of data being used are often very similar, but there might be some differences (e.g., text corpora from humanities).  -->
<!-- 3. One key is to emphasize that an important part of 'data' likely not brought up by the groups is information about how they were recorded, decisions about how to code them, corrections, etc. -->
<!-- 4. Important: look to see if the definitions include the word "PLAN": managing data requires a PLAN.  This will let you segway into... -->
