### **ASSIGNMENT:** Correctly Formatted, Named, and Stored Data Files (XXXX points)
### **DUE DATE:** The assignment is due XXXXX.  
### **SUBMISSION:** See below

One of the goals this semester is to take a “messy” dataset, clean it, organize it, and – assuming you have permission – archive it in a repository. This assignment is the opportunity to show the how you moved from a “raw” dataset to a “clean” one. 

For this assignment I need you to submit the following: 

1)	The original raw dataset(s) (xls, csv, xlsx, txt, doc, other, list of photo or audio files).

2)	A file of R code (.r) used to clean and reorganize the raw dataset (renaming columns, making corrections, the conversion of information in cells into codes, etc.). 

3)	The clean, correctly formatted, and properly named dataset(s) (ideally a csv or txt file; if your dataset is something else check with me in advance).

I should be able to use your code to go from #1 to #3. Do not worry at all about what your code looks like. This is not a programming class – I do not care if the code is elegant, efficient, or sophisticated, only that it works.  This tweet from Hadley Wickham, who wrote some of the most widely used and important R packages out there, says it all:

Please submit the assignment via e-learning. To submit the assignment, you can either (1) upload the three files or you can (2) provide a link to a folder where I can review the three files (e.g., on Dropbox, MS One Drive, etc.). You may have to invite me to review the folder; if so, you can use the address embruna@ufl.edu. If you have any issues just let me know.
